h·u + k·v + l·w = 0
``` :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

So:

* **More layers meeting the law → more diffraction spots → the pattern looks “crowded”.**  
* Directions where only a few layers satisfy the law look “sparse”.

There is one extra twist: some layers *never* diffract because of the way lattice points are arranged inside the unit cell (the **centering extinction rules**). For example, in a face-centred lattice every allowed reflection must have all three indices either *all even or all odd*; mixed parities like 110 are forbidden, so they never contribute to the count :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

Your script simply:

1. **Generates every set of Miller indices** up to `±hmax`.  
2. **Throws away** any set that is forbidden by the centering rule or (optionally) lies outside a reciprocal-space sphere `gmax`.  
3. **Tests every small integer direction** `[u v w]` (again within `±hmax`).  
4. **Counts** how many surviving planes obey `h u+k v+l w=0`.  
5. **Sorts** the directions by that count and prints the top few — the “most crowded” views.

## 2.  Logic check & fixes 🔍

| Section | What it does | ✔ / ✖ | Notes / fixes |
|---------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| `passes_centering` | Applies extinction rules | **✖** for F, A & B lattices | Rule should be: ```python
if cent == "F": return (h % 2 == k % 2 == l % 2)  # all even OR all odd
if cent == "A": return (k + l) % 2 == 0
if cent == "B": return (h + l) % 2 == 0```<br>These conditions match the standard table of integral reflection conditions :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. |
| `passes_centering` for P, I, C, R | Correct | ✔ | `P`, `I` (h+k+l even) and `C` (h+k even) match references :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. |
| `unique_axis` argument | Accepted but unused | ⚠ | Either remove the CLI option or incorporate it (e.g., restrict axes in monoclinic lattices). |
| `reciprocal_vector` | Returns |g| (length) | ✔ | Doc-string says “vector”, but the code returns a scalar; rename for clarity. |
| Zone-axis loop | Uses GCD to keep primitive directions; counts planes with Weiss law | ✔ | Sound approach and uses the same zone law cited above. |
| Output ranking | Correct | ✔ | |

With the centering bug corrected the counts for F, A and B lattices will drop for forbidden reflections (e.g., 110 in fcc will disappear), giving physically meaningful “crowdedness”.

### Why those directions win

* **High-symmetry axes** (e.g., `[001]` in cubic) intersect many evenly spaced planes, so they naturally satisfy the zone law for many `(hkl)` sets.
* In centered lattices, axes aligned **along the centering translations** pick up the largest number of *allowed* planes after extinctions.
* Adding the reciprocal-length cut-off `gmax` mimics an experimental resolution limit: only low-|g| planes (large d-spacings) are counted, so the script’s idea of “crowded” matches what your detector would actually see.

### Take-away

*Fix the three centering rules* and your script will give reliable, citation-backed crowded-axis lists.  
Everything else — the zone-law counting and the optional |g| filter — is logically sound and does exactly what you intended.
